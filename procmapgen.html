          <h1>Concept</h1>
          <p>
            I have always been fascinated by the idea of procedurally generating
            content for games. In the past I experimented with perlin noise in
            the Unity engine and have attempted my own version of "wave function
            collapse". I have never tried to really build 3d environments
            procedurally before though. I did some research and found many well
            document example of placing prefabricated rooms randomly and
            connecting them. But I wanted to see if the rooms could also be
            randomly generated as well. This is my first attempt at this
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main inspiration for this project were medieval castles. I
            researched different layouts and designs and noted how they were
            constructed. Towers would surround the castle and within it there
            were wards that would connect to the main rooms of the castles. Each
            main room would be connected to smaller support rooms; for example a
            kitchen would have a buttlery, bottlery or pantry adjacent to it.
          </p>

          <h1>Implementation</h1>

          <p>
            To create these rooms, a field of points would be generated with
            <a href="https://www.jasondavies.com/poisson-disc/"
              >Poisson-disc sampling</a
            >. These points would encompass the size of the map and the density
            would be dependent on the the resolution of the mesh that would make
            up the room.
          </p>

          <p><img src="./images/procgen_points.jpg" alt="Untitled" /></p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation"
              >Delaunay triangulation</a
            >
            was then applied to triangulate the points generated. After this
            process any triangles that had extreme angles would be removed.
          </p>

          <p><img src="./images/procgen_triangles.jpg" alt="Untitled" /></p>

          <p>
            From here, a new field of points were generated to serve as spawn
            points for the rooms. These points were then trimmed to remove any
            near the borders of the map.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            For every tower that needs to be created, a random spawn point is
            chosen and a tower would be generated at that point. A random point
            within the tower would be chose as its "center" and using
            <a
              href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-algorithm-for-adjacency-list-representation-greedy-algo-8/"
              >Dijkstra’s algorithm</a
            >
            to find the shortest path, the "walls" of the castle are defined and
            all potential spawn points outside of the walls are removed.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            Spawns for main rooms are picked first, then their support rooms.
            After checking that all rooms have spawn points and that there are
            enough triangles to build all the rooms the layout is accepted. The
            rooms are built by "growing" the mesh from the rooms spawn points.
            Adjacent triangles are selected until the room is large enough or it
            runs out of room, then the process begins all over. Rooms are shown
            below as colored regions. Once all rooms have been constructed, the
            rooms are connected by a Delaunay triangulation again and using
            <a
              href=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-greedy-algo-5/
              >Prim’s Algorithm</a
            > a minimum spanning tree graph is made to ensure all
            rooms are reachable.
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            To connect each of the rooms together a path would need to be found
            between each room. Using the edges from the graph created by the
            MST, a path could be found by using the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"
              >A* algorithm</a
            >. If paths were formed that went through adjacent rooms, doorways
            could be added, if the paths went through empty space, hallways are
            created to connect the rooms.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>

          <p>
            This project taught me a lot about managing time complexities and
            optimization. The algorithm to generate a useful layout would
            sometimes take many iterations to produce a usable outcome. Further
            optimizations could still be taken from here, like using heap sort
            for A*, creating a single data structure for nodes instead of
            different structures for triangle data and node data. I think from
            here I'd like to explore irregular grids. I'd like to aim for an end
            result with a bit more uniformness, but this has been a fun stepping
            stone in my journey to learn more about procedural generation.
