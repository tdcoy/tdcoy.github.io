              Back in 2013 I downloaded Unity version 4.0 and watched as a cube
              spun around after I typed my first lines of code. I was enamored
              with this new power and would go on to create many prototypes and
              projects within the Unity engine. This new found hobby would
              inspire me to return to university to get my bachelors in computer
              science from UNC Greensboro in May of 2023. During this period as
              a fulltime student, I sold shrimp out of a cooler on the side of
              the road on weekends and renovated a derelict house whilst I lived
              in it.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my freetime I have been building interactive 3D apps with Three
              JS, 3D modeling and creating tools for zine making.
            </p>

            <p>
              When away from the computer I enjoy restoring my 1987 Toyota Van,
              hiking, fossil hunting and writing a

              <a href="https://hillresidence.bigcartel.com/"
                >zine about King of the Hill.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
              I am hoping to fill this in with professional work, but until then
              here is a list of all the roles I have played in student group
              projects.
            </p>

            <h4>Senior Project, Spring 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Collaborated with 3 other students to create a CRUD webapp that
              used machine learning to predict a career path for the user based
              on a personality quiz. My main focus in the project was on the
              front end, but I also helped integrate the machine learning into
              the project. Our group managed the project by holding weekly
              scrum's and constantly tested the project during the development
              cycle.
            </p>

            <h4>Software Development Project, Spring 2022</h4>
            <p>
              Group project with 3 other students to create a CRUD webapp. We
              developed a website to browse and purchase products, review
              previous orders and create user accounts. Designed the front admin
              functionality to add, remove and change products in the store.
              Also created the backend to save customer information and orders
              using PHP and SQL. My main tasks were creating the front end using
              Html and CSS.

                  <h4>Van Driver</h4>
                  <p>
                    Another Unity project. Van driver was meant to be an online
                    co-op simulation of driving a 1987 Toyota van on a road
                    trip. Players would have to work together to keep the van
                    running as it constantly broke down and presented
                    challenges. The networking side of things was handled using
                    my own custom server and client made using
                    System.Net.Sockets.

                  <h4>Grid Inventory</h4>
                  <p>
                    Again made in Unity, this project was a prototype to
                    replicate a multi-slot-grid inventory similar to that in
                    Diablo. Functionality included: rotating items, stacking
                    items, item specific containers, the abilitiy to store
                    containers within containers, and auto sorting.

                  <h4>First Person Farm Game</h4>
                  <p>
                    This Unity project was created to experiment with a
                    different style of crafting system. A cross between
                    Minecraft and Ultima, items could be placed in the crafting
                    window and if the correct combination of items were placed
                    in the window then the player could retrieve the result.
                    This project also featured a farming simulation where
                    players could plant seeds and plants would grow based on its
                    growing cycle and later be harvested.
