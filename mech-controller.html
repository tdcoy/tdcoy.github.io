          <h1>Concept</h1>
          <p>
            Long ago I was gifted a hand-me-down PC that my father built for
            himself in the late 90's. It was the first computer that was fully
            my own. I was obsessed with anything to do with giant robots at the
            time and one of the first 3D games I got for my new computer was
            Mechwarrior 2 Mercenaries. Mech sims were very much in vogue at the
            time and I was there for it. Fast forward to the early 2000's and
            Mechwarrior 4 was finally released. It was so well polished and
            smooth, the mechanics of that game stuck with me for years. So when
            I first discovered <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> I had
            an itch to try and create a third-person mech controller using the
            library.
          </p>
          <p>
            The manual for Three.js held my hand to get a project setup and I
            really wanted to be able to host the project publically with github
            pages. My first attempt resulted in a simple character controller
            that would move a cube around on a flat plane. This was fine, but I
            quickly realized that some sort of physics was going to need to be
            present to push the project further. Upon some research I found a
            <a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js">project</a> that was
            essentially a javascript wrapper for the
            <a href="https://pybullet.org/wordpress/">bullet engine</a>. Even
            more so I came across
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@simondev758">Simon Dev</a>, a
            youtuber that focus's on 3D applications made with javascript and
            who's work would become a great resource for the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            After getting a demo scene up and running it seemed appropriate to
            update my cube with something more interesting to look at. So I
            fired up Blender and whipped up a little robot.

          </p>
          <p>
            After figuring out how to import the skeleton and get the Blender
            stuff converted to Three.js stuff, I had a nicely rigged and walking
            robot. My usual workflow for low poly assets is to model it and then
            find free-use images with interesting details to use for textures.
            For this model I went to
            <a href="https://images.nasa.gov/">nasa's image library</a>, a
            horible and clunky website, found a few images and collaged them
            together. Here you can see how the highlighted portion of the mesh
            is unwrapped and laid over the texture to achieve that low-res
            aesthetic. I like to use the same image to texture a model so the
            lighting is consistent, but sometimes other images are needed for
            more defined details.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            At this time I also created another simplified mesh to use as the
            collider for the model and made a simple level to test with. Using
            the Bullet physics engine is pretty intemidating to be honest. If it
            weren't for Simon's tutorial on integrating it I would have been
            scratching my head for awhile on that one. You essentially have to
            create 2 seperate "instances" of the game and sync them together.
            One "graphics world" visible to the player, and another "physics
            world" where all collisions are calculated based on kinetic
            controllers and collision meshes. The lower fideltiy collision
            meshes make it cheaper to calculate collisions, but can cause some
            weird graphical issues if gone too far. Other issues I ran into with
            the physics, if I made a valley too steep for the collider, it would
            just fall through. Not a big deal, just something to keep in mind
            when creating levels.
          </p>

          <h1>Implementation</h1>
          <h2>Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            It was import to me that movement feel natural and fluid to the
            user. I wanted it to feel like the mech had weight and momentum as
            it moved. So when the torso rotated it needed to feel heavy and
            react to the users mouse input accordingly. So I bound the rotation
            to the horizontal movement of the mouse and applied a linear
            interpolation. For vertical rotation I did a similar thing but
            instead of rotating the torso, I rotated the gun turret instead.
            Some games will rotated the torso in both axis, but in my mind
            treating it like a tank turret where the gun and turret rotate in
            independent axis makes a lot more since. So when the player is
            sitting stationairy, the turret rotates with the camera, but when
            the player starts moving, the legs will snap in allignment with the
            direction of movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only real trick was properly getting the gun turret to inherit
            the parent torso's position and rotation. Since objects in Three.js
            have both local and world coordinates, it just required finding
            which quaternions were needed and it all worked out.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="./images/mech-turret-rotate.gif" alt="Untitled" />
          </p>

          <h2>Movement</h2>
          <p>
            To handle movement the users input was captured for axis of movement
            and the direction the camera was facing was applied to create a new
            vector for the direction of movemvent in either direction. This
            vector could then be passed to the physics controller and the
            character controller. It was important to me that the legs move
            independently of the torso. So I just rotated the legs in the
            direction of the movement vector to achieve that effect. But this
            did produce a new problem, the legs and torso were one single
            animated mesh. So I had to go back to my blender file and seperate
            them into 2 seperate meshes so I could apply rotations on them
            seperately.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            At this time I also created a simple UI crosshair that helped sell
            the feeling of weight a lot better. It consits of 2 parts, a dot
            that is always fixed to the center of the screen and a circle that
            follows the rotation of the camera. Which is fine, but the torso
            only rotates on the horizontal axis, the gun turret rotates on both
            horizontal and vertical. But the gun turret is offset from the
            center so the follow-crosshair would always be a little off center.
            My solution was to create a point far off in space that was attached
            to the gun turret so the offset would become unnoticable. A little
            hack-y, but it works.
          </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            Overall I am very happy with how it turned out. The movement feels
            very fluid and natural with just the right amount of lead. Three.js
            supports raycasting, so I'd like to implement shooting and hit
            detection at some point. I even made a little drone that follows the
            player around.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found that breaking projects up into little pieces helps me
            maintain a realistic scope and thus I actually finish things. So,
            for now this is finished. If you want to play around with it all the
            code is on my <a href="https://github.com/tdcoy">github</a>. I'd
            like to have it running on github pages, but I haven't figured out
            how to setup node.js with it yet.
